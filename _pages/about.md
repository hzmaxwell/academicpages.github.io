I'm an assistant professor at Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences.
Currently, I'm studying the applications of machine learning to biological data.
I was previously working on machine learing techniques for scene perception and path planning in autonomous driving, and earned my PhD degree from NUDT in 2018.
During 2016--2018, I was a visiting student at UCL computer science.
