I'm an assistant professor in Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences. Currently, I'm focusing on using machine learning to tackle biological problems---in order to make human live better.
Previously I was using machine learing for scene perception and path planning in autonomous driving, and earned my PhD and MSc degrees from NUDT in 2018 and 2013, respectively. During 2016--2018, I was a visiting student in UCL computer science.

# Research interest:
* **Machine learning**: deep learning, recurrent neural networks, unsupervised learning, Bayesian statistics.
* **Bioinformatics**: single-cell genomics, single-cell transcriptomics.
* **Computer vision**: image segmentation, object detection, object tracking, depth estimation, image reconstruction.
* **Robotics**: path plannig, motion planning.
