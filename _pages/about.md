I'm an assistant professor at Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences.
Currently, I'm studying the applications of machine learning to biological data.
I was previously working on machine learing techniques for scene perception and path planning in autonomous driving, and earned my PhD and MSc degrees from NUDT in 2018 and 2013, respectively.
During 2016--2018, I was a visiting student at UCL computer science.


# Research Interest:
* **Machine learning**: deep learning, recurrent neural networks, unsupervised learning, Bayesian statistics.
* **Bioinformatics**: genomics, transcriptomics, single-cell analysis.
* **Computer vision**: image segmentation, object detection, object tracking, depth estimation, image reconstruction.
* **Natural language processing**: language modeling, machine translation.
* **Robotics**: path plannig, motion planning.
