I'm an assistant professor at Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, focusing on Bayesian methods and deep learning for biological problems.
I was previously working on machine learing techniques for scene perception and path planning in autonomous driving, and earned my PhD from NUDT in 2018.
During 2016--2018, I was a visiting student at UCL computer science.


## Research Interest
* **Computational biology**: transcriptomics, single-cell analysis
* **Probabilistic modeling**: Bayesian nonparametrics, variational inference, Monte Carlo methods
* **Deep learning**: recurrent neural networks, deep generative models
